# WeightLoss

Tracking weight loss at the start of 2022. 

## Strategy

 - I have significantly reduced my carbohydrate intake, cutting out most bread, 
     rice and pasta.
 - I am going to the gym almost every day, aiming to burn about 400 calories 
     each visit.

I hope to lose 0.5 kg/week to 1 kg/week, and to reduce my weight from 100 kg to 
90 kg.
